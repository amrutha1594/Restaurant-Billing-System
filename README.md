This Python project is a **console-based restaurant billing system** that allows users to:

* **Display a categorized menu** (Veg and Non-Veg) using a dictionary.
* **Take customer orders**, including item name and quantity.
* **Validate inputs** to ensure items exist in the menu and quantities are valid.
* **Generate a bill number** by reading and updating a file (`billno.txt`).
* **Calculate totals**, including a 7% tax, and display a **formatted bill**.
* **Print a receipt-style output** with restaurant details and total amounts.

The system uses **basic Python features** like loops, conditionals, and file handling, and requires **no external libraries**. It's ideal for small restaurants or as a beginner Python project.
